# The goal is to show to the kid that you can change something in one place
# and you will get change in another place.
# On each step you need to discuss with the child that line
# "print 1 + x". Find the resolution like 1 finger + 2 fingers = 3 fingers.
# Requirements:
# Keys "Backspace" and "Enter" should be known before (you can involve the kid to type that program)
# Side effect:
# Getting known operation Save File, switch to terminal, re-run previous command.
